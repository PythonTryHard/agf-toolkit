## 1. Terminology
- `Gear string` refers the comma-separated string of characters that is used to encode all of a gear piece's properties.
- `Stat string` refers to the comma-separated string of characters that is used to encode a gear piece's stat's 3 values.

Both of the above strings are to be referred to collectively as `encoded string`.

## 2. Overall requirements
- The valid character set for the encoded string is `[0-9.,%-]`
- All values in the encoded string are separated by one (01) ASCII comma `,` character.
- Null values are to be represented as `-1` in the encoded string, and when parsed results in the equivalent of `null` value.

## 3. Mappings
All values in the encoded string are mapped to their respective values in the following tables:

|      Gear type      | Encoded value |
|:-------------------:|:-------------:|
|    Weapon System    |       1       |
|    Power System     |       2       |
|    Shield System    |       3       |
|  Propulsion System  |       4       |
|  Aiming Component   |       5       |
| Amplifier Component |       6       |

|       Gear set        | Encoded value |
|:---------------------:|:-------------:|
|        ATK set        |       1       |
|  Counter Engine set   |       2       |
|     Critical set      |       3       |
|   Critical DMG set    |       4       |
|        DEF set        |       5       |
|        HP set         |       6       |
|     Lifesteal set     |       7       |
|     Immunity set      |       8       |
|      Riposte set      |       9       |
|        SPD set        |      10       |
|    Status ACC set     |      11       |
| Status Resistance set |      12       |

| Rarity grade | Encoded value |
|:------------:|:-------------:|
|    Yellow    |       1       |
|    Purple    |       2       |
|     Blue     |       3       |
|    Green     |       4       |
|    White     |       5       |


| Stat type  | Encoded value |
|:----------:|:-------------:|
|    ATK     |       1       |
|    DEF     |       2       |
|     HP     |       3       |
|  ATK (%)   |       4       |
|  DEF (%)   |       5       |
|   HP (%)   |       6       |
|    SPD     |       7       |
|  Critical  |       8       |
|  CRIT DMG  |       9       |
| Status ACC |      10       |
| Status RES |      11       |


## 4. Stat string requirements
A `stat string` is to be structured as followed:
```
StatString := <stat_type:int>,<stat_rarity:int><stat_value:float|str>
```

## 5. Gear string requirements
A `gear string` is to be structured as followed:
```
<gear_set:int>,<gear_type:int>,<gear_rarity:int>,<gear_star:int>,<gear_main_stat:StatString>[,<gear_sub_stat:StatString>]*
```
